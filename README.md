# discord.lua

This repository is a concept for a `discord.lua` library.
For good reasons, switch to `discord.py` or use Discordia instead.

## Installation

Download `curl` and `libwebsockets`.

REQUIRED:
`cd` to your main.lua parent directory/folder. DO NOT run your script while in another directory.

Copy the `discord/` to your main.lua parent directory/folder. Simple.
```
local discord = require("discord")
